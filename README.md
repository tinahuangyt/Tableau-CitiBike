# Tableau-CitiBike

The goal of this project is to generate a utilization report for the New York City Citi Bike Program. Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage. For this project, data from June 2018 to May 2019 is collected. 

Data downloaded from the Citi Bike webpage is cleaned and combined using Pandas on [data_cleaning.ipynb](data_cleaning.ipynb), subsequent analyses were performed with Tableau Public.

The complete analysis report can be viewed [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/StartStationMap/Summary?:embed=y&:display_count=yes&publish=yes&:origin=viz_share_link), a PDF version is also avaiable [CitiBike_Report.pdf].
